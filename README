This code is configured using the autogen.sh bash script, it uses
libtoolize, aitomake and autogen to create a configure script which is
run to produce a makefile. I did not have access to VisualStudio so I
have not tested it in this IDE.

This code has been compiled with gcc v. 4.6.1. 

The options "-Wall" and "-std=c++0x" were used.

The code produces a library that is called libManagerContainer.so.

The tmc.cpp code is compiled and linked against this library as an
example/test of the features in the design.
